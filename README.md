<h1>Secret Friend</h1>

An application that allows users to enter friends' names into a list and then perform a random draw to determine who is the **"secret friend"**.

The user must add names using a text field and an **"Add"** button. The names entered will be displayed in a list visible on the page, and upon completion, a **"Draw Friend"** button will randomly select one of the names, showing the result on the screen.

### Features:

- **Add names:** Users will type a friend's name into a text field and add it to a visible list by clicking **"Add"**.
- **Validate input:** If the text field is empty, the program will display an alert asking for a valid name.
- **View the list:** The names entered will appear in a list below the input field.
- **Random Draw:** When you click the **"Draw Friend"** button, a name will be randomly selected from the list and displayed on the page.
